Purpose:		This file defines the html code necessary to run our WebGL 2 program.
I've made an attempt to separate the parts of the program using the Model-View-Controller 
design pattern. The model.js, view.js, and controller.js files define the code for those 
components respectively. I define the vertex and fragment shader code in this file.
For Lab 7 we also start loading the gl-matrix.js file to perform matrix operations.
